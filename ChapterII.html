      <article class="tracking-widest p-3 indent-8 text-justify">
        <p>A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product. These activities may involve the development of software from scratch
in a standard programming language like Java or C. However, business applications
are not necessarily developed in this way. New business software is now often developed by extending and modifying existing systems or by configuring and integrating
off-the-shelf software or system components.</p>
        <br><p>There are many different software processes but all must include four activities
that are fundamental to software engineering:</p>
      </article>
      <article class="tracking-widest pl-8">
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-justify">
        <li>
            <strong>Software specification:</strong> The functionality of the software and constraints on its
            operation must be defined.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Software design and implementation:</strong> The software to meet the specification
            must be produced.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Software validation:</strong> The software must be validated to ensure that it does what
            the customer wants.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Software evolution:</strong> The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article class="tracking-widest p-3 indent-8 text-justify">
            <p>In some form, these activities are part of all software processes. In practice, of
    course, they are complex activities in themselves and include sub-activities such as
    requirements validation, architectural design, unit testing, etc. There are also supporting process activities
    such as documentation and software configuration management.</p>
            <br><p>When we describe and discuss processes, we usually talk about the activities in
        these processes such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc., and
        the ordering of these activities. However, as well as activities, process descriptions
        may also include:</p>
      </article>
      <article class="tracking-widest pl-8">
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-justify">
        <li>
            Products, which are the outcomes of a process activity. For example, the outcome of the activity of architectural design may be a model of the software
            architecture.
            </li>
        <li>
            Roles, which reflect the responsibilities of the people involved in the process.
            Examples of roles are project manager, configuration manager, programmer, etc.</li>
        <li>
            Pre- and post-conditions, which are statements that are true before and after a
            process activity has been enacted or a product produced. For example, before
            architectural design begins, a pre-condition may be that all requirements have
            been approved by the customer; after this activity is finished, a post-condition
            might be that the UML models describing the architecture have been reviewed.</li>
        </ol>
      </article>
      <article class="tracking-widest p-3 indent-8 text-justify">
            <p>Software processes are complex and, like all intellectual and creative processes,
            rely on people making decisions and judgments. There is no ideal process and most
            organizations have developed their own software development processes. Processes
            have evolved to take advantage of the capabilities of the people in an organization
            and the specific characteristics of the systems that are being developed.</p>
            <br><p>For some systems, such as critical systems, a very structured development process is required.
            For business systems, with rapidly changing requirements, a less formal, flexible
            process is likely to be more effective.
            </p>
            <br><p>Sometimes, software processes are categorized as either plan-driven or agile
            processes. Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are
            planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. In agile processes,
            which I discuss in Chapter 3, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the
            process to reflect changing customer requirements. <br><br>As Boehm and Turner (2003)
            discuss, each approach is suitable for different types of software. Generally, you
            need to find a balance between plan-driven and agile processes.</p>
            <br><p>Although there is no ‘ideal’ software process, there is scope for improving the
            software process in many organizations. Processes may include outdated techniques
            or may not take advantage of the best practice in industrial software engineering.
            Indeed, many organizations still do not take advantage of software engineering
            methods in their software development.</p>
            <br><p>Software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diversity in software processes across an organization is reduced. This leads to improved
            communication and a reduction in training time, and makes automated process support more economical. Standardization is also an important first step in introducing
            new software engineering methods and techniques and good software engineering
            practice. I discuss software process improvement in more detail in Chapter 26.</p>

        <h1 class="mt-1 text-xl font-bold tracking-widest pt-3">2.1 Software Process Models</h1>
        <article class="tracking-widest p-3 indent-8 text-justify">
            <p>As I explained in Chapter 1, a software process model is a simplified representation
            of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. For example,
            a process activity model shows the activities and their sequence but may not show
            the roles of the people involved in these activities. In this section, I introduce a number of very general process models (sometimes called ‘process paradigms’) and
            present these from an architectural perspective. That is, we see the framework of the
            process but not the details of specific activities.</p>
            <br><p>These generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes. Rather,
            they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to
            software development. You can think of them as process frameworks that may be
            extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.</p>
            <br><p class="indent-0">The process models that I cover here are:</p>
        </article>
        <article class="tracking-widest pl-8">
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 text-justify">
        <li>
            The <strong>Waterfall Model</strong> This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate
            process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Incremental Development</strong> This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions
            (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reuse-oriented Software Engineering</strong> This approach is based on the existence of
            a significant number of reusable components. The system development process
            focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing
            them from scratch.</li>
